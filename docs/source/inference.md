# OpenFold3 Inference

Welcome to the Documentation for running inference with OpenFold3, our fully open source, trainable, PyTorch-based reproduction of DeepMind’s AlphaFold3. OpenFold3 implements the features described in [AlphaFold3 *Nature* paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w).

This guide covers how to use OpenFold3 to make structure predictions.


## 1. Inference features

OpenFold3 replicates the full set of input features described in the *AlphaFold3* publication. All features of AlphaFold3 are **fully implemented and supported in training**. We are actively working on integrating the same functionalities into the inference pipeline.

- Covalently bound ligands
- Polymeric ligands such as glycans


## 2. Pre-requisites

- OpenFold3 Environment. See [OpenFold3 Installation](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/docs/source/Installation.md) for instructions on how to build this environment (for both Conda and Pixi).
- OpenFold3 Model Parameters. See {ref}`OpenFold3 Setup <setup-openfold3-parameters>` for an easy option to download model parameters.


## 3. Running OpenFold3 Inference

A prediction job can be submitted with the following command:

```bash
run_openfold predict --query-json=<query_json>
```

Sample input query jsons can be found in the [examples/example_inference_inputs](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/tree/main/examples/example_inference_inputs) directory.

Full output directories are provided on the [OpenFold HuggingFace repo](https://huggingface.co/OpenFold/OpenFold3/tree/main/examples). These include:
- Single-chain protein (monomer) -- Ubiquitin (PDB: 1UBQ)
- Multi-chain protein with identical chains (homomer) -- GCN4 leucine zipper (PDB: 2ZTA)
- Multi-chain protein with different chains (multimer) -- Deoxy human hemoglobin (PDB: 1A3N)
- Protein-ligand complex -- Mcl-1 with small molecule inhibitor (PDB: 5FDR)


### 3.1 Input Data: Query JSON

Queries can include any combination of single- or multi-chain proteins, with or without ligands, and may contain multiple such complexes. <br/>
Input is provided via a `query.json` file — a structured JSON document that defines each query, its constituent chains, chain types (e.g., protein, DNA, ligand) and sequences or molecular graphs. Optionally, the query can include paths to precomputed protein or RNA MSAs. <br/>
See {doc}`OpenFold3 input format <input_format_reference>` for instructions on how to specify your input data.


### 3.2 Inference Modes by MSA Input
OpenFold3 currently supports three inference modes with respect to MSAs:

- 🚀 With ColabFold MSA Server (default)
- 📂 With Precomputed MSAs
- 🚫 Without MSAs (MSA-free)

Each mode shares the same command structure but differs in how MSAs are provided or generated.

(default-inference)=
#### 3.2.1 🚀 Inference with ColabFold MSA Server (Default)

This mode automatically generates MSAs using the ColabFold server. Only protein sequences are sent to the server. We recommend this mode if you only have a couple of structures to predict.

```bash
run_openfold predict \
    --query-json /path/to/query.json \
    --use-msa-server \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/
```

This command uses the `run_openfold` binary, for which the source code is available [here](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/openfold3/run_openfold.py).

**Required arguments**

- `--query-json` *(Path)*
    - Path to the input query JSON file.

**Optional arguments**

- `--inference-ckpt-path` *(Path, optional)*
    - Path to a model checkpoint file (`.pt` file)
    - Will use a default checkpoint if not specified, which will be downloaded on the first inference run. See {doc}`parameters_reference`
 for details 

- `--inference-ckpt-name` *(str, optional, default = `openfold3_p2_v1`)* 
    - Name of model checkpoint from a supported list to be used for inference. Only used if `inference_ckpt_path` is `None`. See {{doc}`parameters_reference` for information 

- `--use-msa-server` *(bool, optional, default = True)*
    - Whether to use the ColabFold server for MSA generation.

- `--output-dir` *(Path, optional, default = `test_train_output/`)*
    - Directory where outputs will be written.

- `--num-diffusion-samples` *(int, optional, default = 5)*
    - Number of diffusion samples per query.

- `--num-model-seeds` *(int, optional, default = 1)*
    - Number of random seeds to use per query.
    - To manually select specific seeds, please use the `runner.yml` and refer to the {ref}`Custom Random Seeds section <custom-random-seeds-inference>` below.

- `--runner-yaml` *(Path, optional, default = null)*
    - YAML config for full control over model and data parameters. See the {doc}`configuration reference <configuration_reference>` and [full configuration reference file](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/examples/reference_full_config/full_config.yml) for all available options.
    - See the {ref}`runner yaml section below for more information <33-customized-inference-settings-using-runneryml>` 

📝  *Notes*: 
- Only protein sequences are submitted to the ColabFold server so this mode only uses MSAs for protein chains.
- All arguments can also be set via `runner_yaml`, but command-line flags take precedence and will override values specified in the YAML file (see [Customized Inference Settings](33-customized-inference-settings-using-runneryml) for details).


#### 3.2.2 📂 Inference with Precomputed MSAs
This mode allows inference using MSA files prepared manually or by external tools. We recommend this mode for high-throughput screeing applications where you want to run hundreds or thousands of predictions. See the {doc}`precomputed MSA documentation <precomputed_msa_how_to>` for a step-by-step tutorial, the {doc}`MSA generation guide <precomputed_msa_generation_how_to>` for using our MSA generation pipeline and the {doc}`precomputed MSA explanatory document <precomputed_msa_explanation>` for a more in-depth explanation on how precomputed MSA handling works. 

An example query json with a sample of how the alignment directories can be formatted is available [here](https://huggingface.co/OpenFold/OpenFold3/tree/main/examples/multimer_precomputed_msa) 

```bash
run_openfold predict \
    --query-json /path/to/query_precomputed.json \
    --use-msa-server=False \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/ \
    --runner-yaml /path/to/inference_precomputed.yml
```

(323-inference-without-msas)=
#### 3.2.3 🚫 Inference Without MSAs
You can run OpenFold3 without MSAs. Prediction performance may be worse than predictions that use MSAs

```bash
run_openfold predict \
    --query-json /path/to/query.json \
    --use-msa-server=False \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/ \
    --runner-yaml /path/to/inference.yml
```

(33-customized-inference-settings-using-runneryml)=
### 3.3 Customized Inference Settings Using `runner.yml`

OpenFold3 provides extensive customization options through a `runner.yml` configuration file. This file allows you to override the default settings defined in [`validator.py`](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/openfold3/entry_points/validator.py) and customize the inference behavior to your needs.

We provide several example runner files in our [examples directory](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/tree/main/examples/example_runner_yamls) that demonstrate common use cases like:

- Running on multiple GPUs
- Using low memory settings
- Customizing output formats
- Enabling cuEquivariance kernels
- Enabling AMD ROCm Triton kernels
- Saving MSA and Template processing outputs
- And more

For a complete reference of all available configuration options:

- See our [full configuration example](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/tree/main/examples/reference_full_config/full_config.yml) with all possible settings
- Read the detailed [configuration reference documentation](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/docs/source/configuration_reference.md) that explains each setting

**Important Note on Model Parameter Customization:**

The default settings of the model are defined in [`openfold3/projects/of3_all_atom/config/model_config.py`](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/openfold3/projects/of3_all_atom/config/model_config.py#L87)

The model parameters section of the configuration may by passing an update in the `runner.yml` under the `custom` field in `model_update`. See the [`cuequivariance.yml` example](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/examples/example_runner_yamls/cuequivariance.yml) for one such update. 


Note that CLI arguments take precedence over configuration file settings.

#### 🏠 Persistent User-Default Configuration

OpenFold3 automatically searches for a base `runner.yml` at `$OPENFOLD_CACHE/runner.yml` (defaults to `~/.openfold3/runner.yml`). If found, it applies these settings globally without requiring the `--runner-yaml` flag.

*Note: The path of the loaded default configuration is tracked in `experiment_config.json` under `"user_default_runner_yaml_path"`.*

Below we'll walk through some of the most common configuration scenarios and how to implement them:


(inference-run-on-multiple-gpus)=
#### 🖥️ Run on Multiple GPUs or Nodes
The inference pipeline (as well as training) is backed by[ `Pytorch Lightning`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/), which allows us to automatically distribute large batch jobs of multiple predictions across all available GPUs and nodes. To enable distributed inference, specify the hardware configuration under [`pl_trainer_args`](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/aadafc70bcb9e609954161660314fcf133d5f7c4/openfold3/entry_points/validator.py#L141) in your `runner.yml`:

```yaml
pl_trainer_args:
  devices: 4      # Default: 1
  num_nodes: 1    # Default: 1
```

---

(custom-random-seeds-inference)=
#### 🌱 Change the random seeds for the model 

By default, only 1 random model seed is used with 5 diffusion samples, in which case, one inference run will be performed, yielding 5 output structures using the same seed.

Given `n` queries, `m` seeds and `l` diffusion samples, the model will perform `n × m` independent forward passes and produce `n × m × l` predicted structures.

A custom list of random seeds can be provided to the `runner.yml` under [`experiment_settings`](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/aadafc70bcb9e609954161660314fcf133d5f7c4/openfold3/entry_points/validator.py#L120) in the following format

```yaml
experiment_settings:
  seeds:
    - 100
    - 101
    - ... 
```

Seeding behavior is controlled in the following priority:
- Command line argument `--num-model-seeds`
- `runner.yml` via the `experiment_settings.seeds` field.

---

#### 📦 Structure output format
The EnsembleFold `predict` wrapper writes structures as CIF and rejects other
`output_writer_settings.structure_format` values during inference. The native
`OF3OutputWriter` library API continues to support `pdb`, `cif`, and `cif.gz`
for direct library use.

---

(output-model-embeddings)=
#### 📦 Output single and pair model embeddings
To save model embeddings, add the field `write_latent_outputs` to the `output_writer_settings` i.e.: 
```yaml
output_writer_settings:
  write_latent_outputs: True
```

---

#### ⏩ Skip full confidence model outputs
OpenFold3 writes both aggregated confidence scores and full, per-atom confidence scores. See [Prediction Outputs](41-prediction-outputs) for more information.

For large inference jobs, especially jobs with many seeds, it is useful to skip the full confidence score generation to save disk space. This can be done with the following settings

```yaml
output_writer_settings:
  write_full_confidence_scores: False 
```

---

(inference-low-memory-mode)=
#### 🧠 Low Memory Mode
To run inference on larger queries to run on limited memory, add the following to apply the [model presets](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/openfold3/projects/of3_all_atom/config/model_setting_presets.yml) to run in low memory mode.

Note: These settings cause the pairformer embedding output from the diffusion samples to be computed sequentially. Significant slowdowns may occur, especially for large number of diffusion samples.
```yaml
model_update:
  presets:
    - predict  # required for inference
    - low_mem
```

---

#### 🔴 AMD ROCm Inference with Triton Kernels

On AMD GPUs, OpenFold3 can use native Triton kernels for the Evoformer attention and TriangleMultiplicativeUpdate layers instead of the default CUDA-specific kernels.

First, install PyTorch for ROCm and openfold3 (see [Installation](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/docs/source/Installation.md)).
Then enable the Triton kernels in your `runner.yml` using the provided [`triton.yml`](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/examples/example_runner_yamls/triton.yml) example:

```yaml
model_update:
  presets:
    - predict
  custom:
    settings:
      memory:
        eval:
          use_triton_triangle_kernels: true
          use_deepspeed_evo_attention: false
          use_cueq_triangle_kernels: false
```

```bash
run_openfold predict \
    --query-json /path/to/query.json \
    --output-dir /path/to/output/ \
    --runner-yaml examples/example_runner_yamls/triton.yml
```

> **Note on first-run compilation**: Triton JIT-compiles kernels on first use and caches them to `~/.triton/cache`. The compilation is a one-time cost per unique sequence length per machine; subsequent runs at the same length incur no overhead.

---

#### 🍎 Apple Silicon (MPS) Inference

On Apple Silicon Macs, OpenFold3 automatically detects and uses the MPS backend -- no `runner.yml` changes are required.

Install the `openfold3-base` pixi environment (see [Installation](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/docs/source/Installation.md)), then run the same minimal command as any other platform:

```bash
run_openfold predict --query-json=/path/to/query.json --output-dir=/path/to/output/
```

MPS inference is currently ~3-5x faster than CPU-only inference for the same query.

---

(inference-cif-direct-templates)=
#### 🧬 CIF Direct Template Mode

OpenFold3 supports providing template structures directly as CIF files without requiring pre-computed template alignments. In this mode, the system automatically:
1. Parses each provided CIF file
2. Extracts all chains and their sequences
3. Aligns each chain to your query sequence
4. Selects the best matching chain based on sequence identity × coverage score

This is particularly useful for stateless inference environments or when you have specific template structures but no alignment files.

**Usage:**

In your query JSON, specify `template_cif_paths` instead of `template_alignment_file_path`:

```json
{
    "queries": {
        "my_query": {
            "chains": [
                {
                    "molecule_type": "protein",
                    "chain_ids": ["A"],
                    "sequence": "MKLLVVDDAGQKFT...",
                    "template_cif_paths": [
                        "path/to/template1.cif",
                        "path/to/template2.cif",
                        "path/to/template3.cif"
                    ],
                    "template_cif_chain_ids": ["A", null, "B"]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Optionally, use `template_cif_chain_ids` to specify which chain to use from each CIF file. Use `null` to let the system automatically select the best-matching chain.

**Configuration:**

You can adjust the minimum score threshold for chain selection in your `runner.yml`:

```yaml
template_preprocessor_settings:
  cif_direct_min_score: 0.1  # Default: 0.1 (seq_identity × coverage)
```

**Notes:**
- For multi-chain CIF files, only the best matching chain per file is used as a template
- The `template_cif_paths` field cannot be used together with `template_alignment_file_path`
- This mode is currently supported for protein chains only

---

### 3.4 Customized ColabFold MSA Server Settings Using `runner.yml` 

All settings for the ColabFold server and outputs can be set under [`msa_computation_settings`](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/openfold3/core/data/tools/colabfold_msa_server.py)


(34-saving-msa-outputs)=
#### Saving MSA outputs

OpenFold saves both forms of MSA output by default:

- OpenFold-formatted alignments are saved to `<output_dir>/msas/<run-id>`.
- Raw ColabFold server outputs are saved to `<output_dir>/msas/raw/<run-id>`.

When temporary MSA work is needed, each run uses a unique workspace. OpenFold removes that workspace when the command finishes normally or exits through a handled error. The saved files are a record of that run. OpenFold does not automatically reuse them as a cache.

You can turn off either output in `runner.yml`:

```yaml
msa_computation_settings:
  save_openfold_outputs: true
  save_colabfold_outputs: false
```

For multi-node inference that generates MSAs, keep `save_openfold_outputs` enabled and put the output directory on storage that every node can read. Rank zero broadcasts its alignment paths to the other ranks, and the temporary workspace may be local to the node that created it.

Set `colabfold_output_dir` when raw records need a different parent directory.
Each run still receives its own child directory there.

OpenFold copies raw files as soon as the ColabFold server query finishes. It saves the formatted alignments after MSA processing completes. Each per-chain file or directory uses the sequence hash as its name. `save_mappings` includes the chain, sequence, and representative ID mappings in the organized OpenFold record.

Set `msa_output_directory` to save the OpenFold-formatted alignments to an exact directory instead of the default per-run directory. OpenFold still uses and removes a separate temporary workspace. If `colabfold_output_dir` is not set, the raw files are saved under `<msa_output_directory>/raw`. Existing exact destinations remain supported, but OpenFold does not automatically read them as a cache.

##### Running the MSA server separately

Use `align-msa-server` when you want to generate alignments before running prediction. Put all queries for the job in one query JSON so OpenFold can deduplicate the server requests across that set.

```bash
run_openfold align-msa-server \
    --query-json queries.json \
    --output-dir output/alignments
```

The command writes the alignments and `query_msa.json` under `output/alignments`. The paths in that JSON remain valid after the separate temporary workspace is removed. The command always saves the organized alignments because the JSON depends on them. Pass this JSON to `predict` with `--use-msa-server false` to use the saved alignments without querying the server again.

---

#### Use a Privately Hosted ColabFold MSA Server
Specify the URL of your private MSA server with the `server_url` field:
```yaml
msa_computation_settings:
  server_url: https://my.private.colabfold.server
```

---

#### Save MSAs in A3M Format
Choose the file format for saving MSAs retrieved from ColabFold:
```yaml
msa_computation_settings:
  msa_file_format: a3m     # Options: a3m, npz (default: npz)
```

(35-using-pocket-constraints)=
### 3.5 Using Pocket Constraints

Use Pocket Constraints to guide ligand binding in the pocket during inference time using directed diffusion seeds. See {ref}`Section 4 of the input format reference <4-pocket-constraints>` for more information on how to specify a pocket constraint.

Pocket Constraints can be enabled / disabled using the following runner yaml settings. Other settings such as the amount of jitter and conformer settings may also be tuned, please see the {ref}`Pocket Sampling Settings reference <full-ref-pocket-sampling-settings>`.

```yaml
datset_config_kwargs:
  pocket_sampling:
    enabled: True  # default
```

## 4. Model Outputs

The inference pipeline creates a dedicated output directory for each query, named by the corresponding query key (for example, `query_1` or `3hfm` when a PDB ID is provided). Prediction results are stored there. By default, saved MSA records are stored under `<output_dir>/msas`.

(41-prediction-outputs)=
### 4.1 Prediction Outputs

Each seed produces `l` diffusion samples. Sample numbers retain their original
zero-based diffusion order:
```bash
<output_directory>/query_1/
├── models/seed-42_sample-0_model.cif
├── summary_confidences/seed-42_sample-0_summary_confidences.json
├── full_data/seed-42_sample-0_full_data.npz
└── timing.json
```

- `models/*_model.cif`: Final predicted 3D structure.
  
- `full_data/*_full_data.npz`: Per-atom confidence scores, compressed and
  stored as float16 by default (`json` and float32 remain configurable):

  - `plddt`: Predicted Local Distance Difference Test
  
  - `pae`: Predicted Aligned Error 

  - `pde`: Predicted Distance Error

- `summary_confidences/*_summary_confidences.json`: Aggregated metrics:

  - `avg_plddt` - Average pLDDT over structure

  - `gpde` - Global Predicted Distance Error (see AF3 SI Section 5.7 Eq. 16)
  
  - `ptm` - Predicted TM score of a full complex (SI §5.9.1)

  - `iptm` - Interface variant of a predicted TM score of a full complex (SI §5.9.1)

  - `disorder` - Average relative solvent accessible surface area (RASA) over all protein atoms (§5.9.3, item 1)

  - `has_clash` - Whether any pair of polymer chains has steric clashes (0.0 if no clashes, 1.0 otherwise)

  - `sample_ranking_score` - Weighted sum of `ptm`, `iptm`, `disorder`, `has_clash`. Used to rank predictions (SI §5.9.3, item 1)

  - `chain_ptm` - Per-chain predicted TM score (SI §5.9.1)
  
  - `chain_pair_iptm` - Interface variant of predicted TM score of each chain pairs (SI §5.9.1, §5.9.3, item 3)
  
  - `bespoke_iptm` - Average `chain_pair_iptm` between each chain of a pair and all other chains. Used to rank interface predictions (SI § 5.9.3, item 3)

- `timing.json`: The runtime for the submitted query (s), not including the runtime for any MSA computations.


### 4.2 Processed MSAs (`main/` and `paired/`)
Only created if `--use-msa-server=True`. <br/>
Processed MSAs for each unique chain are saved as `.npz` files used to create input features for OpenFold3. 
If a chain is reused across multiple queries, its MSA is only computed once and named after the first occurrence. This reduces the number of queries to the ColabFold server.


For a sequence with two representative chains, the final output directory would have this format:

```bash
<output_dir>/msas/<run-id>
├── main
│   ├── <hash of sequence A>.npz
│   └── <hash of sequence B>.npz
├── mappings
│   ├── chain_id_to_rep_id.json
│   ├── query_name_to_complex_id.json
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── rep_id_to_seq.json  # hash to sequence mapping
│   └── seq_to_rep_id.json
└── paired
    └── <hash of concatenation of sequences A and B>
        ├── <hash of sequence A>.npz
        └── <hash of sequence B>.npz
```


If a query is a heteromeric protein complex (has at least two different protein chains) and `--use-msa-server` is enabled, **paired MSAs** are also generated. 
If a set of chains with a specific stoichiometry is reused across multiple queries, for example if the same heterodimer is screened against multiple small molecule ligands, its set of paired MSAs is only computed once and named after the first occurrence. This reduces the number of queries to the ColabFold server. 

```bash
<output_dir>/msas/<run-id>
 ├── paired
    └── <hash of concatenation of sequences A and B> 
        ├── <hash of sequence A>.npz
        └── <hash of sequence B>.npz
```

In summary, we submit a total of 1 + n queries to the ColabFold MSA server per run - one query for the set of all unqiue protein sequences in the inference query json file (unpaired/main MSAs) and n additional queries for the collection of unqiue protein chain combinations for heteromeric complexes (paired MSAs).

The MSA deduplication behavior is also present for precomputed MSAs. See the {ref}`chain deduplication utility <4-msa-reusing-utility>` section for details.

Raw ColabFold `.a3m` files and helper scripts are saved under `<colabfold_output_dir>/<run-id>`. During inference, the parent defaults to `<output_dir>/msas/raw` when `msa_output_directory` is not set.

### 4.3 Mapping outputs (`mappings/`)

The mapping files describe the sequences and representative IDs in the saved MSA record. When the same explicit `msa_output_directory` is reused, the `rep_id_to_seq.json` and `seq_to_rep_id.json` mappings gain the new sequences, while the other mappings are overwritten.

```bash
<output_dir>/msas/<run-id>
 ├── paired
    └── <hash of concatenation of sequences A and B> 
        ├── <hash of sequence A>.npz
        └── <hash of sequence B>.npz
```

### 4.4 Query Metadata 
There are several system-generated files that record the state of submitted inference job.

- [Inference Query Set](441-inference-query-set-json) -- Input query and references to auxiliary files (e.g. MSA alignments and template files)
- [Model Config](442-model-config-json) - Model settings, e.g. architecture and memory settings
- [Experiment Config](443-experiment-config-json) -- Experiment settings for the inference run

(441-inference-query-set-json)=
#### 4.4.1 Inference Query Set (`inference_query_set.json`)
This file representing the full input query in a validated internal format defined by [this Pydantic schema](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/openfold3/projects/of3_all_atom/config/inference_query_format.py).

- Created automatically from the original `query.json`.

- If `--use-msa-server=True`, automatically populates:

  - `main_msa_file_paths`: Paths to single-chain `.a3m` or `.npz` files

  - `paired_msa_file_paths`: Paths to paired `.a3m` or `.npz` files (if heteromer input)

  Note: Refer to the {doc}`Precomputed MSA Documentation <precomputed_msa_how_to>` for how to specify these fields if you want to use precomputed MSAs instead of MSAs from the Colabfold server.

- If `--use-templates=True`, automatically populates:

  - `template_alignment_file_path`: Path to the preprocessed template cache entry `.npz` file used for template featurization. By default, template cache entries are automatically created in a short preprocessing step using the raw template alignment files provided under this same field and the template structures identified in the alignment. 

  - `template_cif_paths`: List of paths to CIF template files when using {ref}`CIF direct template mode <inference-cif-direct-templates>`. This field is mutually exclusive with `template_alignment_file_path`.

  - `template_cif_chain_ids`: List of chain IDs to use from each corresponding CIF file in `template_cif_paths`. Use `null` for entries where automatic chain selection is desired. Must have the same length as `template_cif_paths` if provided.

  - `template_entry_chain_ids`: List of template chains, identified by their entry (typically PDB) IDs and chain IDs, used for featurization. By default, up to the first 4 of these chains are used.

  Note: Refer to the {doc}`Template How-To Documentation <template_how_to>` for how to specify these fields if you want to use precomputed template alignments instead of Colabfold alignments for template inputs, or see {ref}`CIF Direct Template Mode <inference-cif-direct-templates>` for using template structures directly without alignments.

#### 4.4.3 Experiment Config (`experiment_config.json`)

This file records the entire state of the experiment, as defined by the [InferenceExperimentConfig pydantic model](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold-3/blob/main/openfold3/entry_points/validator.py#L347).


**🔗 Example:**

See the full multimer output for [Deoxy human hemoglobin](https://huggingface.co/OpenFold/OpenFold3/tree/main/examples/output_multimer_with_colabfold_msas), generated with `run_multimer.sh`. This published example predates the per-run MSA directory layout described above, so it keeps the `colabfold_msas` and `colabfold_templates` directories directly in the output directory.


When processing multimer inputs (e.g., hemoglobin α + β chains), OpenFold3 automatically:

- Requests paired MSAs from the ColabFold server
- Stores raw alignments in `raw/paired/` temporarily
- Converts them into per-chain `.npz` alignments in [`paired/`](https://huggingface.co/OpenFold/OpenFold3/tree/main/examples/output_multimer_with_colabfold_msas/colabfold_msas/paired)

### 4.5 Embeddings

At inference you can instruct the model to produce the pair-rep and single-rep embeddings by {ref}`adjusting the output_writer_settings in your runner.yaml <output-model-embeddings>`. 

This will cause the model to produce a `*_latent_output.pt`, which can be loaded like so and has the following shape. 

```python
output = torch.load("*_latent_output.pt")
print(output.keys())
["si_trunk", "zij_trunk", "atom_positions_predicted"]
```

If you want to change these outputs, the code is in the [model.py](../../openfold3/projects/of3_all_atom/model.py#L384-L388)
