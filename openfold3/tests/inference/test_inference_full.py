"""Smoke tests for inference: small queries run end-to-end.

``test_inference_writes_outputs`` runs every case in ``CASES`` against every combination
of ``use_msa_server`` and ``use_templates``, checking the expected output files are
written for each query the case contains. Cases mix in-memory query sets with the query
JSONs under ``examples/example_inference_inputs``, so adding either kind is one row —
and costs four inference runs. See ``test_templates.py`` for the functional check that a
supplied template actually steers the prediction.

These require an accelerator (CUDA, ROCm or MPS) and downloaded model weights; they skip
otherwise.

Run with:
    pytest openfold3/tests/inference/test_inference_full.py

Accuracy is asserted on the **mean over** ``SCORED_DIFFUSION_SAMPLES`` **diffusion
samples**, never on a single one — see that constant for why a single sample's RMSD is
not a portable quantity. Thresholds follow from the measured distribution rather than
from one observation: see :class:`ProteinExpectation` for the rule.

To calibrate a case — run it in all four modes and read the per-sample values, mean and
sd off the log (``log_cli_level`` is WARNING by default, so INFO has to be asked for),
then apply the rule in :class:`ProteinExpectation`:

    pytest openfold3/tests/inference/test_inference_full.py -k ubiquitin \\
        -v --log-cli-level=INFO

Every measurement is logged before it is asserted, so a run that trips a threshold still
prints everything needed to recalibrate it. Drop ``-x`` when calibrating: fail-fast stops
at the first tripped mode and leaves the others unmeasured.

    Both bounds apply to the **mean CA-RMSD over diffusion samples**, in Ångström, keyed
    by :class:`Mode`. A mode absent from a mapping is measured and logged but not
    asserted by it — how close a prediction lands depends strongly on whether it had an
    MSA and a template, so no single bound is right across all four, and a bound is only
    worth asserting once it has been *measured* in that mode.

    ``rmsd_max`` is a ceiling: the prediction must be at least this good.
    ``rmsd_min`` is a floor — the prediction must be at least this *bad*. That is not a
    perverse assertion but the positive control for the MSA path: some targets are not
    solvable single-sequence, and pinning "without an MSA this must stay ~15 Å out"
    catches an MSA pipeline that silently stops contributing, which no ceiling can.
    ``test_templates.py`` makes the same argument for templates.

    Calibrating a bound
    -------------------
    Run the mode, read the logged mean and sd, and take::

        ceiling = round_up_0.1(max(mean + 4 * sd / sqrt(n), 1.5 * mean))

    The ``4 * SE`` term covers the noise of the mean itself. The ``1.5 x`` term covers
    what more samples cannot: run-to-run variation, live MSA-server payload differences,
    and the fact that backends do not run identical kernels — the ``mps`` preset
    disables the fused triton triangle kernels that CUDA uses, so the two compute
    genuinely different fp32 results before any noise is drawn.

    A bound is only valid for the backend it was measured on until a *wider*
    distribution turns up elsewhere. Ceilings are one-sided, so calibrating on the widest
    backend seen so far is automatically safe for every more accurate one; the values
    here were measured on MPS, which is currently the widest. Do not tighten a ceiling to
    a narrower backend's numbers — that is exactly how these came to be CUDA-only.
