#: Diffusion samples drawn for a case whose prediction is scored against experiment.
#:
#: Accuracy is asserted on the *mean* over this many samples, never on one of them.
#: A single sample's RMSD is not reproducible across backends: diffusion noise is drawn
#: on-device (``diffusion_module.sample_diffusion``, ``centre_random_augmentation``), so
#: each accelerator has its own RNG stream and the same seed replays a different draw.
#: On ubiquitin the per-sample CA-RMSD spans 0.79-1.72 Å, an order of magnitude wider
#: than the accuracy differences these tests exist to detect.
#:
#: 8 rather than more because the samples share one trunk pass: raising N shrinks only
#: the within-trunk spread, and the run-to-run and cross-device terms — which it cannot
#: touch — are already the larger ones. Costs ~1.4 s per extra sample against a ~36 s
#: trunk, so the whole increase is a rounding error on an already-slow test.
